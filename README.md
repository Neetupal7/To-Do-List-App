# To-Do-List-App
The To-Do List app is a simple web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks in a digital to-do list format. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible and easy to use for users across different devices and browsers.

Key Features:

Task Creation: Users can add new tasks by entering a description and pressing the "Add" button. Each task is represented by a list item on the user interface.

Task Management: Once a task is created, users can perform various actions such as marking it as complete, editing the task description, or deleting the task. These options provide flexibility and control over task management.

Task Persistence: The To-Do List App incorporates JavaScript's local storage capabilities to store tasks locally in the user's web browser. This ensures that the tasks remain saved even if the user closes the app or refreshes the page, providing a seamless and uninterrupted experience.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for creating the basic structure and layout of the web application.
CSS: Used for styling the user interface, including fonts, colors, and layout.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the dynamic functionality of the app, such as task creation, deletion, editing, and persistence.
Overall, the To-Do List App project combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a user-friendly and feature-rich task management solution. It aims to improve productivity and organization by providing a convenient way for users to stay on top of their tasks and deadlines.
